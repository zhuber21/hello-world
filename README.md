# hello-world
Building a test repository

I am hoping to use GitHub for a variety of work related to experimental and computational cosmology. Let me know if you have any cool projects I should be aware of!

For reference, I currently work on the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, Simons Observatory, and CCAT-prime projects as a graduate student in physics.
